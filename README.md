This is an application that does preliminary calculations required in the design of planar sundials. It accepts the following user input data:

    • Longitude
    • Latitude
    • Time-zone
    • Daylight Savings Time Adjustment
    • Dial Declination 
    • Dial Reclination
    • Dial Plate Transparency
    • Dial Type 
    • Equation of Time Mode

and then generates the following to enable planar sundial construction: 

    * Hour Angles
    * Equation of Time + Local Standard Time + Daylight Saving Time correction data
    * Gnomon Angles
    * Gnomon Lengths
  
The application also has input sliders so that the dial designer may select suitable declination and reclination values so as to allow adequate separation of the hour angles and clearer dial reading.
